# CIS3590_Project
Load CSV files containing water quality observations. 
Clean the data by removing outliers using the z-score method.  
Store the cleaned data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB or mongomock locally).  
Build a Flask REST API to make the data available with filters and statistics. 
Develop a Streamlit client that requests data from your API.

In the project we:

Practice ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) by reading CSVs, cleaning data, and loading into a database.

Learn how to design and build REST APIs with Flask.

Understand how a client (Streamlit) communicates with an API.

Create interactive data visualizations with Plotly.
