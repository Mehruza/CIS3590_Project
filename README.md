# CIS3590_Project
Load CSV files containing water quality observations.  Clean the data by removing outliers using the z-score method.  Store the cleaned data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB or mongomock locally).  Build a Flask REST API to make the data available with filters and statistics.  Develop a Streamlit client that requests data from your API.
